**Table Schema**
```postgresql
create table if not exists post_likes (
      id bigint generated by default as identity primary key,
      slug text not null unique,
      likes bigint not null default 0 check (likes >= 0),
      created_at timestamptz not null default now(),
      updated_at timestamptz not null default now()
);

-- Auto-update updated_at on row modification
create or replace function update_updated_at_column()
    returns trigger language plpgsql as $$
begin
    new.updated_at = now();
    return new;
end; $$;

-- Trigger to call the function before any update on `post_likes` table
create trigger trg_update_updated_at
    before update on post_likes
    for each row execute function update_updated_at_column();

-- Index to optimize queries ordering by likes in descending order
create index if not exists idx_post_likes_desc on post_likes (likes desc);
```
